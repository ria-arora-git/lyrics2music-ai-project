LYRICS = """How come you still you don't know
How hard this is for me
You drive around without a care
And i try not to be seen

You grew your hair out 
You are a different person now
What happened to who 
you used to be?

Last few years were just a hit
To my heart and every being
How do we clean the mess we made
At the top of all our fears

People come and people go
They leave few pieces behind
The laugh and love we shared
It comes back to haunt my dreams

It's far too gone
to bring it back
I know but i can't believe
the glances stolen
two heart broken
What did we even achieve?"""
